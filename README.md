# HAR-using-Sparse-Weighted-Temporal-Attention

## Abstract

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a crucial field for enabling machines to understand human actions from sensor data. This project introduces a **Sparse Weighted Temporal Attention Mechanism** to enhance HAR, particularly for data from drone cameras. This technique allows the model to focus on the most important moments in a sequence of actions, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of the recognition process. By integrating this mechanism, the system can better interpret human actions, leading to more precise and reliable results for applications in healthcare, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.

## Methodology

The core of this project is a novel approach that integrates a Sparse Weighted Temporal Attention (SWTA) module with a robust backbone network to classify human activities from video frames.

![Methodology Overview](Images/metod.drawio.png)

*Overview of Methodology*

The workflow is as follows:
1.  **Temporal Frame Sampling**: Video frames are extracted and divided into segments using a **Temporal Segment Network (TSN)** to capture long-range temporal information efficiently.
2.  **Attention Mechanism**: A **Sparse Weighted Temporal Attention (SWTA)** module is applied. This module calculates optical flow between sparsely sampled frames and uses it to create an attention map, effectively highlighting motion changes. This map is then fused with the original RGB frames.
3.  **Human Detection**: The **YOLOv8** model is used to detect and crop the human subjects from the frames, isolating them from the background for more focused analysis.
4.  **Feature Extraction**: The processed frames are fed into a backbone network, an **Inception V3** architecture pre-trained on ImageNet, to extract high-level features.
5.  **Classification**: Finally, fully connected layers and a Softmax activation function classify the action into one of the predefined categories.
